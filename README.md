![alt text](https://github.com/fnndyl/Generic-FluidNC-6-Stepper/blob/main/PCB_layout.png "PCB Layout")

Designed for controlling a Stewart Platform, but applicable to any application for which FluidNC is desired to drive steppers with all the bells and whistles that comes with a CNC firmware package. 

Designed using KiCad 9.0. Ordered through JLCPCB. All components are through-hole and expected to be hand soldered. Uses cheap Wroom Devkit, molex connectors for motors and limit switches, and DRV8825 stepstick drivers. *It may be possible to use fancier drivers - not tested, PCB may require modification.*
